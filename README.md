#Towards ensemble classification algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis in women
Effective breast cancer diagnosis entails systematic image analysis, characterization, and integration of many clinical and mammographic variables. A perfect diagnostic system would discriminate between benign and malignant findings perfectly. Regrettably, flawless discrimination has not been realized, so radiologists’ decisions are founded on their best judgment of breast cancer risk amidst substantial uncertainty. When there are numerous interacting predictive variables, and decision-making strategies founded on inherent experience and memory, it may lead to errors and erraticism in practice and hence significant misdiagnosis and its intrinsic effects on both patients and the medical personnel. Thus, this calls for better and more accurate methodologies for the diagnosis of breast cancer, an endeavor the researcher undertook.
We studied classification algorithms towards an accurate breast cancer discrimination model between malignant and benign tissues and a prediction of future risk of the disease by patients. We used R language to perform simulation experiments on cancer dataset to build models towards the cause. We performed a comparative analysis of the models in terms of accuracy, precision and recall of the algorithms on well prepared datasets that were that were dimensionally reduced to appropriate levels. K-fold cross validation and feature optimization for model tuning was done to improve on the robustness of the models and achieve high accuracy rates.  
Finally, we performed model ensembles with bagging, boosting and stacking model from the heterogenous base algorithms of Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Random forests, Naïve Bayes and Partial least squares-discriminant Analysis, whose computational complexity is affordable. Their predictions were combined through stacking based on logistic regression to build an ensemble with higher accuracy rates of discriminating malignant from benign patients and predict a future risk of the disease and attaining a balance between bias and variance
